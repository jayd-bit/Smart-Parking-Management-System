# Smart-Parking-Management-System
The Smart Parking Management System streamlines parking operations using Python, offering real-time slot updates, vehicle tracking, and efficient space utilization. With an intuitive interface and data storage, itâ€™s perfect for developers or businesses exploring automated parking solutions.

Automated Parking Space Detection System
Today, most parking lots operate inefficiently, leading to drivers spending a lot of time searching for available spaces, exacerbating traffic congestion, and resulting in wasted time and money. This project aims to address these challenges by implementing an automated parking space detection system.

Introduction
The objective of this project is to alleviate the problems associated with inefficient parking lots. By deploying an automated system, it seeks to improve traffic flow, save time and money, enhance public services, reduce vehicle emissions and pollution, and provide a better experience for city visitors. Additionally, the system aims to optimize garage utilization and prevent unnecessary capital expenditures.

Methodology
The project focuses on image processing as the key technology for parking space detection. Cameras capture video frames, and software processes these images to identify parking spaces by recognizing green markings. MATLAB serves as the primary platform for implementing this system.

The steps involved in the process include:

Capturing an image of an empty parking lot to identify parking locations based on RGB values.
Converting the image to HSV format to detect green dots representing vacant parking spaces.
Transforming the HSV image to a binary black and white image using thresholding for easy handling.
Removing noise from the image to accurately pinpoint parking spaces.
Results and Discussion
The project implemented various parking scenarios, including empty and full parking lots, to test the system's accuracy. Additionally, different weather conditions were simulated to evaluate the system's performance under various environmental factors.

Conclusion
The image-based procedure for detecting parking space availability was successfully modeled and tested across diverse parking occupancy scenarios. The process involved analyzing parking lot images, identifying empty parking spaces, converting images for analysis, noise reduction, and determining parking space availability.

One of the limitations identified in this project is the impact of weather conditions on image recognition. Future improvements could involve enhancing image filtering techniques to enable reliable recognition in all weather conditions.
